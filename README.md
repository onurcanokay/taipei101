# Taipei101 Oscilation Simulation

This repository contains a script for a single degree of freedom oscilation simulation of Taipei101 and Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) in MATLAB and Simulink.

This simulation demonstrates the crucial role of tuned mass dampers (TMDs) in tall buildings. By dissapating the mechanical energy of an oscilating building, TMDs reduce the oscilations in a building significantly.

In this simulation, the building (Taipei101) and the TMD is modelled as two spring-mass-damper systems having only one degree of freedom. The Taipei101, due to its geographical location, is subjected to strong windloads, which is modelled as a sinusoidal forcing function in this simulation. The sinusoidal forcing function has the natural frequency of the Taipei101 model.
